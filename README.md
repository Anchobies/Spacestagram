It allows users to search through the [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) archive and like the queried picture(s). 

The application is built with React frontend and Ruby on Rails backend. The APOD data is pulled from NASA's [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/). The documentation for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).
